{marker description}{...}
{title:2. Description}

{pstd}
-{cmd:parallel}- allows to implement parallel computing, without having StataMP, 
substantially reducing computing time. Specially suitable for bootstrapping and
simulations, parallel includes out-of-the-box tools for implementing such
algorithms.
{p_end}

{pstd}
In order to use -{cmd:parallel}- it is necesary to set the number of desired clusters
with which the user wants to work with. To do this the user should use -{cmd:parallel setclusters}-
syntaxis, replacing {it:#} with the desired number of clusters. Setting more clusters
than physical cores the user's computer has it is not recommended (see the {help parallel##warnings:WARNING}
in description).
{p_end}

{pstd}
-{cmd:parallel do}- is the equivalent (wrapper) to -do-. When using this syntax
parallel runs the dofile in as many clusters as there where specified by the user, this is,
start {cmd:$PLL_CLUSTERS} Stata instances in batch mode. By default the
loaded dataset will be splitted in the number of clusters specified by -{cmd:parallel setclusters}-
and the {mansection U 16Do-files:do-file} will be executed independently over
each and every one of the data clusters, so once after all the parallel-instances
stops, the datasets will be appended. In order to avoid loading the current
dataset in the clusters, the user should specify the -nodata- option.
{p_end}

{pstd}
-{cmd:parallel :}- (as a prefix) allows to, after spliting the loaded dataset,
execute a {it:stata_cmd} over the specified number of data clusters in order to
speed up computations. Like -{cmd:parallel do}-, after all the parallel-instances
stops, the datasets will be appended.
{p_end}

{pstd}
-{cmd:parallel bs}- and -{cmd:parallel sim}- are parallel wrappers for the commands
-{help bootstrap}- and -{help simulate}-. Specially suited for these algorithms,
-{cmd:parallel}- allows conducting embarrassingly parallel computing. In terms of
syntax, besides cmd names, the only difference that these two commands have with
their serial versions is how are {help exp_list:expressions} passed (please refer
to the {help parallel##examples:examples} section for this).
{p_end}

{pstd}
Every time that -{cmd:parallel}- runs several auxiliary files are generated which,
after finishing, are automatically deleted. In the case that the user sets -{opt keep}-
or -{opt keeplast}- the auxiliar files are kept, thus the syntax -{cmd:parallel clean}-
becomes handy. With -{cmd:parallel clean}- the user can remove the last generated
auxiliar files (default option), an specific parallel instance files (using
{it:#pll_id} number), or every stored auxiliar file (with -{opt all}-). For
security reasons, in-use auxiliary files will not be deleted unless the user
specifies it through the option {opt force}, which will override not deleting
in-use auxiliary files (see the {help parallel##tech:Technical note} section for
more information about this).
{p_end}

{pstd}
In the case of handling multiple files (because it is, for example,
a big dataset divided into multiple dta files), -{cmd:parallel append}- becomes handy
as it allows the user to process them simultaneously. By providing a list of files
and a Stata cmd or dofile, -{cmd:parallel append}- opens and executes the cmd/dofile
within each file, stores each file results and appends them into a single file.
Also, if the files to be processed have a pattern base name, the user can provide
-{cmd:parallel append}- with an expression representing the list of files to be
processed; for information on how to use this feature, see the section
{help parallel##append_how:Parallel Append}.
{p_end}

{pstd}
If the user needs to allow the mother instance to {cmd:break}, users can insert
the command -{cmd:parallel break}- (stata) and the functions 
-{cmd:parallel_break()}- or -{cmd:_parallel_break()}- (mata) in some parts of his
code. These commands/functions check whether the user has pressed the 
{cmd:-break-} key in the mother process.
{p_end}

{pstd}
Given {it:N} clusters, within each cluster -{cmd:parallel}- creates the macros 
{it:pll_id} (equal for all the clusters) and {it:pll_instance} (ranging
1 up to {it:N}, equalling 1 inside the first cluster and {it:N} inside the last cluster), 
both as globals and locals macros. This allows the user setting different
tasks/actions depending on the cluster. Also the global macro {it:PLL_CLUSTERS}
(equal to {it:N}) is available within each cluster. For an example using this
macros, please refer to the {help parallel##examples:Examples section}.
{p_end}

{pstd}
As by now, -{cmd:parallel}- by default automatically identifies stata's
executable file path. This is necessary as it is used to run stata in batch mode
(the mainstream of the module). Either way, after some reports, that file path is not
always correctly identified; where the option -{opt s:tatadir}- in -{cmd:parallel setclusters}-
can be used to manually set it.
{p_end}

{pstd}
In the case of pseudo-random-numbers, the module allows to pass different seed for
each cluster (child process). Moreover, if the user does not provide a numlist of
seeds, -{cmd:parallel}- generates its own numlist of seeds using three diferent options:
(1) based on the current seed; (2) using the current datetime and user as a seed to
generate each seed, restoring the original seed afterwards; or
(3) using random.org API (requires internet conection) to directly generate each
seed (also restoring the original seed afterwards). -{cmd:parallel}- saves a macro
with the used seeds in the {cmd:r(pll_seeds)} macro.
{p_end}

{marker warnings}{...}
{pstd}
{err:WARNINGS} {it:(a)} For each cluster -{cmd:parallel}- starts a new stata instance (thus
running as many processes as clusters), this way, should the user set more clusters
than cores the computer has, it is possible that the computer freezes.
{it:(b)} Unless the user includes -{cmd:parallel break}- within the task (do-file or program),
by this time -{cmd:parallel}- can not stop running the clusters by itself, what
implies that, in the case of any of the clusters starts a endless loop, stoping the
clusters should be done manually by the user by terminating them from the OS's tasks manager.
{p_end}

{marker details}{...}
{title:3. Details}

{pstd}
Inspired by the R library ``snow'' and to be used in multicore CPUs
, -{cmd:parallel}- implements parallel computing methods through an OS's shell 
scripting (using Stata in batch mode) to speedup computations by splitting the
dataset into a determined number of clusters in such a way to implement a 
{browse "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism":data parallelism} algorithm.
{p_end}

{pstd}
The number of efficient computing clusters depends upon the number of physical
cores (CPUs) with which your computer is built, e.g. if you have a quad-core
computer, the correct cluster setting should be four. In the case of simultaneous
multithreading, such as that from
{browse "http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html":Intel's hyper-threading technology (HTT)},
setting -{cmd:parallel}- following the number of processors threads, as it was expected,
hardly results into a perfect speedup scaling. In spite of it, after several tests
on HTT capable architectures, the results of implementing -{cmd:parallel}- according
to the machines physical cores versus it logical's shows small though significant differences.
{p_end}

{pstd}
-{cmd:parallel}- is especially handy when it comes to implementing loop-based
simulation models (or simply loops), Stata commands such as reshape , or any job
that (a) can be repeated through data-blocks, and (b) routines that processes big
datasets (see the {help parallel##append_how:append section}). Furthermore, the commands
-{help parallel##bs:parallel bs}- and -{help parallel##sim:parallel sim}- are
specially designed to easily implement bootstrapping and (monte carlo) simulations
in parallel fashion.
{p_end}

{pstd}
At this time -{cmd:parallel}- has been successfully tested in Windows, Unix
and MacOS for Stata versions 10 to 12.
{p_end}

{pstd}
After several tests, it has been proven that--thanks to how -{cmd:parallel}- has been
written--it is possible to use the algorithm in such a way that other techniques
of parallel computing can be implemented; such as Monte Carlo Simulations, 
simultaneously running models, etc.. An extensive
example through Monte Carlo Simulations is provided
{browse "http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/p/parallel.pdf":here}.
{p_end}

{marker append_how}{...}
{title:4. Parallel Append}

{pstd}Imagine we have several dta files named -income.dta- stored in a set of folders
ranging 2008_01 up to 2012_12, this is, a total of 60 files (12 times 5) monthly ordered
which may look something like this: {p_end}

{col 10}{it:2008_01/income.dta}
{col 10}{it:2008_02/income.dta}
{col 10}{it:2008_03/income.dta}

{col 10}{it:...more files...}

{col 10}{it:2010_01/income.dta}
{col 10}{it:2010_02/income.dta}
{col 10}{it:2010_03/income.dta}

{col 10}{it:...more files...}

{col 10}{it:2012_10/income.dta}
{col 10}{it:2012_11/income.dta}
{col 10}{it:2012_12/income.dta}

{pstd}Now, imagine that for each and every one of those files we would like to
execute the following program:{p_end}

{tab}{cmd: program def myprogram}
{tab}{cmd:{tab} gen female = gender == "female"}
{tab}{cmd:{tab} collapse (mean) income, by(female) fast}
{tab}{cmd: end}

{pstd}Instead of writing a forval/foreach loop (which would be the natural
solution for this situation), -{cmd:parallel append}- allows us to smoothly solve
this with the following command.{p_end}

{tab}{cmd:. parallel append, do(myprogram) prog(myprogram)} ///
{tab}{tab}{cmd:e("%g_%02.0f/income.dta, 2008/2012, 1/12")}

{pstd}Where element by element, we are telling parallel:{p_end}
{tab}(1) {cmd:do(myprogram)}: execute the command -{cmd:myprogram}-,
{tab}(1) {cmd:prog(myprogram)}: -{cmd:myprogram}- is a usr written program, and
{tab}(1) {cmd:e("%g_%02.0f/income.dta, 2008/2012, 1/12")}: this should process files 2008_01/income.dta up to 2012_12/income.dta.

{pstd}Besides of the simplicity of its syntax, the advantage of using -{cmd:parallel append}-
lies in doing so in a parallel fashion, this is, instead of processing one file
at a time, -{cmd:parallel}- manages to process these files in groups of as
many files as clusters are set. Step-by-step, what this command does is:{p_end}

{p2colset 8 11 11 4}
{p2col:1.}Distribute groups of files accross clusters{p_end}

{tab}Once each cluster starts, for each dta file

{p2col:2.}Opens the file using {ifin} acorddingly to {opt in} and {opt if} options.{p_end}
{p2col:3.}Executes the command/dofile specified by the user.{p_end}
{p2col:3.}Stores the results in a temp dta file.{p_end}

{tab}Finally, once all the files have been processed

{p2col:4.}Appends all the resulting files into a single one.{p_end}


{marker caveats}{...}
{title:5. Caveats}

{pstd}
When the -{it:stata_cmd}- or -{it:do-file}- {help saved_results:saves results},
as -{cmd:parallel}- runs Stata in {browse "http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/windows/batch-mode/":batch mode},
none of the results will be kept. This is also true for {help matrix:matrices},
{help scalar:scalars}, {help mata:mata objects}, {help return:returns}, or whatever
other object different from data.
{p_end}

{pstd}
Although -{cmd:parallel}- passes-through {help program list:programs}, {help macro:macros}
and {help mata:mata objects}, in the current version it is not capable of doing the same with
{help matrix:matrices} or {help scalar:scalars}.
{p_end}


{marker tech}{...}
{title:6. Technical note}

{pstd}
In order to protect a {it:pll_id} code (and thus anciliary files), once -{cmd:parallel}-
is called it creates a new file called {it:__pll}[{it:pll_id}]{it:sandbox} 
(stored at c(tmpdir), in your case: {ul:{ccl tmpdir}}). This
forbids -{cmd:parallel clean}- from deleting any auxiliary file used by that process
and reserves the {it:pll_id} so that no other call of -{cmd:parallel}- can
use this {it:pll_id}. Once every child process has finished, the sandbox file
is removed, freeing the {it:pll_id}.
{p_end}

{pstd}
If for any reason the algorithm breaks due to a flaw or crush of the system,
the sandbox file and the rest of auxiliary files will not be deleted. In order
to clean up this, the user will be able to do so manualy (moving the file(s) to
the OS recycle bin) or using {help parallel#clean:parallel clean, all force}
syntax. This way all sandbox files in the c(tmpdir) folder and auxiliary files
stored at the current directory will be deleted.
{p_end}

{pstd}
In earlier versions of -{cmd:parallel}-, {help tempfile:tempfiles} generation was
not safe as while running multiple stata instances simultaneously these could
overwrite each other's tempfiles. Starting version 1.14, this is no longer a
problem as each stata instance starts with a diferent {cmd:c(tmpdir)} location.
This way, instances' tempfile management will not interfere with each other, allowing
to safely use commands or algorithms depending on tempfile generation (such as
{help preserve:preserve and restore}).
{p_end}

{pstd}
The option -{opt setparallelid}- is designed to let programmers recycle a
parallel id ({it:pll_id}). Intended to be used with -{cmd:parallel_sandbox}- 
(undocumented, please refer to the source code of 
-{help parallel_source##parallel_sandbox:parallel_sandbox()}-),
this option allows calling parallel several times using the same {it:pll_id}, which
makes auxiliary files management far simplier. Take the following example
{p_end}

{tab}{cmd: program def mypllwrapper}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:}
{tab}{tab}{it: // Reserving a pll_id}
{tab}{tab}{cmd: m: parallel_sandbox(5)}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:}
{tab}{tab}{it: // Using the generated pll_id}
{tab}{tab}{cmd: save __pll`parallelid'_mypllwrapper, replace}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:}
{tab}{tab}{it: // Recycling the pll_id}
{tab}{tab}{cmd: forval i=1/10 {c -(}}
{tab}{tab}{tab}{cmd: parallel, setparallelid(`parallelid') keep: some_other_cmd}
{tab}{tab}{cmd: {c )-}}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:}
{tab}{tab}{it: // Cleanning up and freeing the pll_id. This will remove all files}
{tab}{tab}{it: // and folders named with prefix '__pll[parallelid]'}
{tab}{tab}{cmd: parallel clean, e(`parallelid')}
{tab}{tab}{cmd: m: parallel_sandbox(2,"`parallelid'")}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:}
{tab}{cmd: end}

{pstd}Computes the maximum of {it:bp} for each patient. We add the option {opt by(patient)}
to tell parallel not to splitt stories.{p_end}
{tab}{cmd:. parallel, by(patient): by patient: egen max_bp = max(bp)}
	
{pstd}Which is the ``parallel way'' to do:{p_end}

{tab}{cmd:. by patient: egen max_bp = max(bp)}
	
{pstd}Giving you the same result.{p_end}

	
{title: Example 2: using -{cmd:parallel do}- syntax}

{pstd}Another usage that may get big benefits from it is implementing loop-base
simulations. Imagine that we have a model that requires looping over each and
every record of a panel-data dataset.
{p_end}

{pstd}
Using -{cmd:parallel}-, the proper way to do this would be using the ``parallel do''
syntax
{p_end}

{tab}{cmd:. use mybigpanel.dta, clear}

{tab}{cmd:. parallel setclusters 4}
{tab}{cmd:. parallel do mymodel.do}
	
{tab}{cmd:. collapse ...}

{pstd}where {it:mymodel.do} would look something like this{p_end}
	
{tab}{hline 35} begin of do-file {hline 12}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:local maxiter = _N}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:forval i = 1/`maxiter'} {cmd:{c -(}}
{tab}{tab}{tab}{cmd:/* Break key check (this line is optional) */}
{tab}{tab}{tab}{cmd:parallel break}
{tab}{tab}{tab}{it:...some routine...}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:{c )-}}
{tab}{hline 35} end of the do-file {hline 10}

{pstd}Or, in the case of using mata, this would look something like this{p_end}

{tab}{hline 35} begin of do-file {hline 12}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:mata:}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:N=c("N")}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:for(i = 1;i<=N;i++) {c -(}}
{tab}{tab}{tab}{cmd:/* Break key check (this line is optional) */}
{tab}{tab}{tab}{cmd:parallel_break()}
{tab}{tab}{tab}{it:...some routine...}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:{c )-}}
{tab}{hline 35} end of the do-file {hline 10}

{title:Example 3: setting the right path}

{pstd}In the case of -{cmd:parallel}- setting the stata.exe's path wrongly, using
-{cmd:setstatapath}- will correct the situation. So, if 
{it:"C:\Archivos de programa\Stata12/stata.exe"} is the right path we only have
to write:

{tab}{cmd:. parallel setclusters 2, s("C:\Archivos de programa\Stata12/stata.exe")}


{title:Example 4: Using -{cmd:parallel bs}-}

{pstd}In this example we'll evaluate a regression model using bootstrapping{p_end}

{tab}{cmd:. simulate mean=r(mean) var=r(Var), reps(10000): lnsim, obs(100)}


{title:Example 6: Using -pll_instance- and -PLL_CLUSTERS- macros}

{pstd}
By using -pll_instance- and -PLL_CLUSTERS- global macros the
user can run -{cmd:parallel}- in such a way that each cluster performs a different
task. Take the following example:
{p_end}

{pstd}Setup for a quad-core computer{p_end}
{tab}{cmd:. parallel setclusters 4}
{tab}{cmd:. sysuse auto, clear}

{tab}{cmd:program def myprog}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:gen x = $pll_instance}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:gen y = $PLL_CLUSTERS}
	
{tab}{tab}{it:// For the first cluster}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:if ($pll_instance == 1) gen z = exp(2)}
	
{tab}{tab}{it:// For the second cluster}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:else if ($pll_instance == 2) {c -(}}
{tab}{tab}{tab}{cmd:summ price}
{tab}{tab}{tab}{cmd:gen z = r(mean)}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:{c )-}}
	
{tab}{tab}{cmd:// For the third and fourth clusters}
{tab}{tab}{cmd:else gen z = 0}
{tab}{cmd:end}

{pstd}Running the program{p_end}
{tab}{cmd:. parallel, prog(myprog): myprog}

{pstd}
Here, running with 4 cores, the program -{cmd:myprog}- performs different actions
depending on the value (number) of -pll_instance-. For those observation in the
first cluster, -{cmd:parallel}- will generate -z- equal to exp(2), for those in 
the second cluster it will compute -z- equal to the average price and for the
rest of the clusters it will generate -z- equal to zero.

{marker source}{...}
{title:10. {cmd:mata} source code}

{pstd}
Most of -{cmd:parallel}- has been programmed in {cmd:mata}. This means that, as a difference
from typical ado files, -{cmd:parallel}- is distributed with {cmd:lparallel} mata library
(compiled code) and thus source code can not be reached directly by users. Given
this, the help file {cmd:{help parallel_source:parallel_source.sthlp}} is included
in the package, help file which contains the source code in a fancy way.
