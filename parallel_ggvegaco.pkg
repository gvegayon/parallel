d 'PARALLEL': module for Parallel Computing
d
d   Inspired in the R library "snow" and to be used in multicore
d CPUs, parallel implements parallel computing methods through 
d OS's shell scripting (using Stata in batch mode) to accelerate
d computations. By starting a determined number of new Stata
d instances (child processes), this module allows the user to
d implement parallel computing methods without the need of having
d StataMP installed. Common tasks include vectorized operations,
d reshaping big data, running simulations (monte carlo experiments)
d or bootstrapping estimations. Depending on the number of cores of
d the CPU, parallel can reach linear speed ups significantly
d reducing computing wall-clock time.
d
d   This current version includes the following commands:
d    - parallel do     for running dofiles.
d    - parallel :      for vectorized commands.
d    - parallel bs     for bootstrapping.
d    - parallel sim    for simulations.
d    - parallel append for handlying multiple dta files.
d
d   Finally parallel is, to the d author's knowledge, the first user
d contributed Stata module to implement parallel computing.
